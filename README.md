# AMD - FrontEnd Seed Framework

This project is meant to appeal to people who want one codebase to work cross-browser and cross-platform web applications
This can be used for Rest based applications only at the moment. It can serve as a Independent FrontEnd Application.

Advantages of using this framework:
  - Extremely fast development
  - Uses LESS for css.
  - Fully prefixed and automated development
  - Easy to export to distribution and extremely small export sizes
  - My personal app was ~ 600kb with libs I needed bundled.
